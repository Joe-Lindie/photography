## Photography Blog

Welcome to my Photography Blog, a platform for sharing images and practicing my Fullstack development skills

## Tech Stack

This is a Fullstack app built with:

- Next.js (version 14)
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Cloud Storage

**Note:** I am using Vercel's free Postgres storage tier. I have exceeded the limits, so I am retrieving the image from Google Cloud's Storage bucket directly rather than the database.

## Deployed Environment

I deployed to Vercel. See the deployed environment [here](https://photography-steel.vercel.app/)
