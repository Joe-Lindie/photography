        Based in London, England. Lover of coffee, coding, and photography. I
        enjoy landscape photography and created this website to display my
        photographs. In the process, it inspired a career change. I am now a
        junior software engineer in training. Across Bindus Photography, you'll
        find a collection of landscapes, cityscapes, and street photography from
        around the globe. With a strong focus on South Korea, Japan, and
        Singapore. I keep my Canon attached to my hand and try to capture the
        world around me. Follow me on my photography and coding journey.
